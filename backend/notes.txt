(9) User Authentication Using JWT & Stored Token In MongoDB Atlas:
        (i) Generate JWT Token and stored it in database.
        (ii) Store that token inside cookies.
        (iii) Get token from cookies and verify the user.

(i) Generate JWT Token and stored it in database:
        > First install jsonwebtoken and we have to use two method
                sign(payload, SecretOrPrivatekey) and verify()

(ii) Store that token inside cookie:
        > use res.cookie(key, geneartedTokenValue, {expiresIn: "". httpOnly: true})
        Note : For testing purpose of cookie passed in loading of profile page.
